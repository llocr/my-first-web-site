  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <img src="javascript.jpg" alt="JavaScript image" width="70%">
  <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
  <p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</p>
